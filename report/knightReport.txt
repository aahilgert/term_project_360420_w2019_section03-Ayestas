Nondeterministic Polynomial Time Completeness of The Knight's Tour using 
Heuristic Recursion 

The knight's tour is a path taken by a chess-piece, while moving according to the allowable vectors associated with the knight-piece, such that the piece visits every real square on a defined chessboard only once.  On classically constructed chessboards (rectangular chessboards) defined by k x n a knight's tour exists only when k is more than n and n is more than or equal to 5. This definition speaks to the existence of a tour on the chessboard in general.  However, tours may be only observed on spaced of a certain geometric type. For example, on a k x n board where k = n = 5, tours will exist only on squares of a certain colour (alternating squares).  

The RealKnightsMoves.java program defines the eight vector paths available to the knight, separated into two matrices defined as the knightsXMoves and knightsYMoves to represent vector components along the X and Y axis.  This
